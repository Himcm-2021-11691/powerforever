Customize your battery based on your needs!

Dear user,
We are glad to inform you that our team have successfully developed a customized model that allows you to choose the battery for your house based on your requirements! Our model was established for users who own a PV powering system and resident in areas of which accessing electricity on-the- grid would be inconvenient.

Our model is consisted of 4 parts. First, we use the home power evaluation model to understand the fundamental power usage in your house. Then, we estimate the output power by PV according to your location and meteorological conditions. Based on home power load model and PV output power, we can obtain the ESS capacity required for a fixed range of power outage frequencies. Third, with the specific needs of users, we take in classical influencing factors of battery into consideration, like cost, using life, power density, energy density and efficiency etc. Lastly, we obtain a few kinds of batteries and provide you with a couple of choices to select.

To give you an actually experience of our newly developed model, we have used your basic information provided to us and generated a few solutions for your 1600 square foot house.
